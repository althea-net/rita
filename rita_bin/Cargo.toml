# we don't call or us OpenSSL directly in this codebase, but by adding
# this dependency with this feature we can enforce that openssl is compiled
# in 'vendored' mode all the way down the tree. What this means is that we use
# an openssl implementation from the crate and not from the system. This adds about
# 3mb to the build so it's tagged into the server feature and it's own feature
