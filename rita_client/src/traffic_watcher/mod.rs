//! Because of the nature of pay per forward billing download traffic (the most common form of end user traffic)
//! requires an exception, in which the Exit and Client have special billing rules that allow for download traffic
//! to be paid for. This is still a net gain to system design simplicity because the general case of an arbitrary number
//! of nodes forwarding an arbitrary amount of traffic can follow the simple pay per forward rules and we only need to
//! account for exceptions on the endpoints of what may be an arbitrarily long, complicated, and changing path.
//!
//! The big advantage of pay per forward is that it reaches a passive consensus state even when there is packet loss.
//! If packets are lost then the next node only sees a slight overpayment. This isn't the case for download traffic, if
//! the client where to keep track of it's download usage all on it's own it would never be able to account for packet
//! loss that the exit may see.
//!
//! So this module contains two major components.
//!
//! TrafficWatcher monitors system traffic by interfacing with KernelInterface to create and check
//! iptables and ip counters on each per hop tunnel (the WireGuard tunnel between two devices). These counts
//! are then stored and used to compute the usage amounts displayed to the user.
//!
//! QueryExitDebts asks the exit what it thinks this particular client owes (over the secure channel of the exit tunnel)
//! validating if this number is correct is difficult, because the exit is serving us with a total debt while our local
//! billing implementation is only producing a delta change. Knowing if the update is fraudulent or not requires heuristics
//! in debt keeper more than anything that can be done here. What we can do here is take action if several requests fail, falling
//! back to local debt computation rather than running blind.
