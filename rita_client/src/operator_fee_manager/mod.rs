//! The operator fee is a fixed fee for service paid to an organizer address
//! The organizer address is also used as the index for all live Althea networks
//! in operator tools, any router with any new operator address will simply poof
//! a network into existence in operator tools.
//!
//! This file contains the logic for the 'operator fee' a pro-rated fixed fee paid
//! out over time by the router automatically, the operator fee can be configured in
//! operator tools or locally on the router.
//!
//! In order to compute the fee a timer is used. So a $100/mo fee equates to 30 microcents
//! a second. The reason we pay out this way is because users really don't like it when their
//! balance changes suddenly, so if they deposit $125 and the router instantly takes $100 to
//! pay their fee it's not a great situation. All that being said it's probable that this
//! will need to be re-written to better reflect a normal billing system at some point, perhaps
//! querying an API for an individual bill. As this is not designed to be a trustless payment
