/// This is the value pay_threshold is multiplied by to determine the close threshold
/// This value is determined as follows
///
/// In the new averaging scheme, consider these constraints and assumptions:
/// 1.) The largest time difference between two routers running is 10x
/// Ex. We have two routers a fast router running every 5sec and a slow running every 50 sec
/// 2.) After EIP1559, the max gas can increase each block is 12.5% of previous block (we take 15% for simplicity)
/// 3.) The total number of entries in our circular array is M  = 100
/// 4.) Let the starting gas that the two nodes are synced on is s
///
/// We need to find the maximum value of CLOSE_THRESH_MULT in the worse case such that the slow router
/// does not enforce the fast router because of disagreeing gas prices. Consdier these cases:
///
/// (I) Right on startup, the array is not filled, only the first 9 blocks have been registered. Lets look at the respective arrays
/// FastRouter: [s, 1.15s, (1.15^2)s, ...., (1.15^9)s]. The average gas here would be = ~20s/10 ~ 2s
/// SlowRouter: [s]. The average here would be s
///
/// Pay_thres for fast = D*T*(2s) (Where D is dynamic fee mult and T is average gas for a transaction)
/// Pay_thres for slow = D*T*s
/// To prevent enforcement, Close_thres of slow > pay_thres of fast
/// D*T*s * CLOSE_THRES_MULT > D*T*(2s) => CLOSE_THRES_MULT > 2
///
/// Without averaging
/// CLOSE_THRES_MULT > (1.15^9) > 3
///
/// (II) Gas price is relatively stable, but sudden jump in price (More realistic)
/// FastRouter: [s, s, s, ... 1.15s, ... (1.15^9)s]. Average is 110s/100 = ~s
/// SlowRouter: [s, s, s, .... s]. Average is s
/// CLOSE_THRES_MULT > 1
///
/// Without Averaging
/// CLOSE_THRES_MULT > (1.15)^9 > 3
///
/// (III) Gas price continues to increase non stop over the course of 50 * M seconds (absolute worst case):
/// FastRouter: [(1.15^9M)s, (1.15^(9M+1))s, .... (1.15^10M)s].
///     Average here would be: s * (1.15^9M) * (1.15^M  -  1)/(1.15  -  1). For M = 100, average = ~3.3s * 10^59
/// SlowRouter: [s, (1.15^10)s, (1.15^20)s ... (1.15^M)s ... (1.15^10M)s].
///     Average here would be s * (1.15^10M  -  1)/(1.15^10  -  1) for M = 100, average = ~1.66s * 10^58
/// So in this case CLOSE_THRES_MULT > 33/1.66 > 20
///
/// Without Averaging
/// CLOSE_THRES_MULT > (1.15^(999))/(1.15^(990)) > 1.15^9 > 3

/// This struct contains important information to determine when a router should be paying and when it should be enforcing on
/// other routers
///
/// 1.) gas_price : latest gas price value. Note that due to routers taking different times to run a loop, different routers
///     may have different values for this field. Post EIP1559, the max price change per block is 12.5% of the previous block
///
/// 2.) payment_threshold : This is the ammount at which a router will make a payment. Below this value, the router will not may a payment since
///     a large portion of the payment will be eaten in fees which is not desirable. This is caluculated by
///     gas_price * gas_required * dynamic_fee_multiplier, where dynamic fee multiplier determines how much larger the payment is
///     compared to the fees (fees are essentially gas_price * gas_required). When this is larger, the router pays less often and
///     vice versa
///
/// 3.) close_threshold : This is a multiple of payment_threshold and determines how many payments a router can miss before enforcing it.
///     For ex. if close_thres is 3 * pay_thres, another router may miss upto 3 payments before it gets enforced upon. Another way to think of this
///     is if a router owes more than the close_thresh, it will get enforced upon.
