// This module is designed to allow easy deposits for some supported chains using Ethereum. The idea
// is pretty simple, the user deposits money into their routers Ethereum address, this is then exchanged
// through uniswap into DAI and then from there it is bridged over to the Xdai proof of authority chains.
// Support for Cosmos chains using a DAI-pegged native currency is next on the list.

// Essentially the goal is to allow users to deposit a popular and easy to acquire coin like Ethereum and then
// actually transact in a stablecoin on a fast blockchain, eg not Ethereum.

// This entire module works on the premise we call the conveyor belt model. It's difficult to track
// money through this entire process exactly, in fact there are some edge cases where it's simply not
// possible to reliably say if a task has completed or not. With that in mind we simply always progress
// the the process for Eth -> DAI -> XDAI. So if we find
// some DAI in our address it will always be converted to XDAI even if we didn't convert that DAI from Eth
// in the first place.

// For the withdraw process we update a lazy static variable every time a withdraw is invoked.
// Every tick, we check for updated withdraw information in the lazy static and use this to
// initiate a withdrawal. From there, we loop to check for events related to the withdraws,
// simulate these, and those that pass are unlocked on the eth side.
